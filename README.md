In this assignment we were assigned to make a search engine using hadoop application at the back end.
First we made an ipynb file where we input the dataset and cleaned it all using different python libraries. In data cleaning we did the following tasks:
~Removed all stop words
~Removed all duplicates 
~Removed all punctuations
~Removed all duplicate Rows
~Dropped rows with missing values
~Removed all special characters

Moreover we also formatted the input file to only use the columns that were needed i.e SECTION_TEXT and ARTICLE_ID

First we make dict of all the sentences then 
~we make a vocabulary of all the words 
then we assign a unique id to all the words
